# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

#Variable Declaration And Input.
Number1=int(input("Enter First Number --> "))
Number2=int(input("Enter Second Number --> "))

#Printing Variable Values.
print("First No. is : ",Number1)
print("Second No. is : ",Number2)

#Operations

print("A / B =",Number1/Number2)
print("A % B =",Number1%Number2)
print("A ** B =",Number1**Number2)
